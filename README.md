### GENRE : MUSICAL & DRAMA 

### RELEASE DATE :  2017-12-20

### MAIN CAST : HUGH JACKMAN, MICHELLE WILLIAMS, ZAC EFRON, ZENDAYA 

### PLOT SYPNOSIS : When the company P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) works for goes bankrupt, he loses his job and has a difficult time supporting his loving wife Charity (Michelle Williams) and their two young daughters. Discouraged by how his life has turned out, he manages to turn things around when he gets an idea.

### FAVORITE ELEMENTS : The Greatest Showman," directed with verve and panache by Michael Gracey, is an unabashed piece of pure entertainment, punctuated by 11 memorable songs composed by Oscar- and Tony-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who composed the songs for "La La Land," as well as the current Broadway hit Dear Evan Hansen. The film is made for the whole family to enjoy, and so it leaves out many of the darker elements (explored in the 1980 Broadway musical Barnum, music by Cy Coleman). This is a difficult tightrope to walk, but credit is due to Gracey, a perfectly cast Hugh Jackman, and the entire cast, who play this story in the spirit in which it was written (by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon). "The Greatest Showman" positions itself as a story celebrating diversity, and the importance of embracing all kinds. 

### FUN FACT : 1. The music and lyrics were written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.


You’ve definitely heard their songs even if you haven’t heard of their names before! In addition to writing for The Greatest Showman, Pasek and Paul alo wrote music and lyrics for Broadway musicals Dear Evan Hansen and A Christmas Story: The Musical, as well as off-Broadway musical Dogfight. Their talent doesn’t stop there, though; they also wrote lyrics for songs in the movie La La Land and a song for the movie Trolls. The craziest part is that they’re only 32 and 33!

 2. Seven of the movie’s leading and supporting actors have backgrounds as successful Broadway performers.


These actors include Hugh Jackman (P.T. Barnum), Michelle Williams (Charity Barnum), Keala Settle (Lettie Lutz, bearded lady), Austyn Johnson (Caroline Barnum), Will Swenson (Philo Barnum, P.T’s father), Byron Jennings (Mr. Carlyle, Phillip’s father) and Eric Anderson (Mr. O’Malley).
